Heavy rain is expected to batter the east coast into Tuesday morning, including parts of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, said the National Weather Service (NWS). This excessive rain will bring with it a slight risk of severe thunderstorms developing over parts of the northeast to the southeast of the US, the agency added. The NWS has also forecast that severe thunderstorms could develop over Texas on Tuesday, where wind gusts could reach 120 km/h or greater. Searing heat will also continued in parts of the US south, with record or near-record high temperatures expected. On Monday morning, more than 120 million Americans woke to severe weather warnings. Sunday was the busiest severe weather day in the US so far this year, with more than 600 reports of storm damage across 20 states. Twisters and heavy winds reduced buildings to piles of rubble, flipped cars and brought down power lines
